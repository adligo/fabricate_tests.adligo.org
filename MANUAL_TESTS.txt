Due to the way Fabricate was written (ad hoc, after tests4j in a hasty manor)
the tests4j tests must be augmented for a few years with some manual tests;

The list of manual tests (+ means passed, - means failed);
1) Run the following a few times in project_group.adligo.org;
	a) fab -p
		Watch the projects dir it should disappear and reappear.
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate the jar files.
		+ 3/24/2015
	b) fab
		Watch the projects dir, it shouldn't disappear.
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate the fjar iles.
		+ 3/24/2015
	c) fab -du
		Watch the development dir, it should have projects added or updated.
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate the jar files.
		- 
2) Run the following a few times from a development directory pick a project (i.e. i_log.adligo.org) 
	fab 
	
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate only the project jar file.
	fab -r  
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate the dependent jar files.
