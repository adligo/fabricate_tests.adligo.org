Due to the way Fabricate was written (ad hoc, after tests4j in a hasty manor)
the tests4j tests must be augmented for a few years with some manual tests;
Last test 3/25/2015

The list of manual tests (+ means passed, - means failed);
1) Run the following a few times in project_group.adligo.org;
	a) fab -p
		Watch the projects dir it should disappear and reappear.
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate the jar files.
		+ 3/25/2015
	b) fab
		Watch the projects dir, it shouldn't disappear.
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate the fjar iles.
		+ 3/25/2015
	c) fab -du
		Watch the development dir, it should have projects added or updated.
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate the jar files.
		+ 3/25/2015

2) Run the following a few times from a project_group projects directory pick a project 
	(i.e. proejct_group.adligo.org/projects/i_log.adligo.org) 
	fab 
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate only the project jar file.
		+ 3/25/2015
	fab -r  
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate the dependent jar files.
		+ 3/25/2015
		
3) Run the following a few times from a development directory pick a project (i.e. i_log.adligo.org) 
	fab 
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate only the project jar file.
		+ 3/25/2015
	fab -r  
		Watch the depot directory, it should delete and recreate the dependent jar files.
		+ 3/25/2015
				
4) Change the project_group.adligo.org fabricate.xml to contain a bad_version and file name
   for fabricate4eclipse.adligo.org
   fab 
      Watch the output of fab, it should contain a error like;
      	did not pass the md5 check.
		7e4225aeabd0f49dc687e37e6433bf1e
		2e4225aeabd0f49dc687e37e6433bf1e
		...
		Version:'bad_version'
		for;
		/Volumes/C_HD/test_src/project_group.adligo.org/fabricate.xml
		
5) Change the project_group.adligo.org fabricate.xml to contain a bad group and file name
   for fabricate4eclipse.adligo.org, i.e. "org.adligo1" instead of "org.adligo"
   fab
    Watch the output of fab, it should contain a error like;
      java.io.IOException: Submitting a Http GET to the following url returned a invalid status code 404;
	  http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/adligo1/fabricate4eclipse/bad_version/fabricate4eclipse_bad_version.jar.md5
	  
6) Repeat the same steps for (4,5) modifying a project dependency and a library dependency.
